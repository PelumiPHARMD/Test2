                            <p>Oluwapelumi Omole, is a third-year student in the Doctor of Pharmacy program (Pharm.D) at Nova Southeastern University (NSU). Mr. Omole is additionally completing a Master’s in Medical Informatics at NSU. He completed most of the prerequisites required for pharmacy school while he was a student at Suncoast Community High School. He was in the Math, Science, and Engineering (MSE) magnet program at his high school, with advanced placement (AP) courses being the core of the magnet program, which in turn contributed to his college credits and prerequisites. While in high school, he also participated in the dual-enrollment program at both Palm Beach State College (PBSC) and Florida Atlantic university (FAU) starting in the 10th grade.  He realized that he was much more inclined towards the sciences than mathematics, and the idea of possibly being an engineer was replaced with pharmacy. So, he enrolled at FAU officially as a college student after high school and graduated with a Bachelor’s in Neuroscience, cum laude. </p>
                            <p>During the summer before his sophomore year of high school, he began volunteering at local public libraries in his community, working mainly in the children’s section. He was involved in making crafts and helping/teaching the children during the summer reading program. For his IPPE Community rotation before the start of the 2nd–year of pharmacy school in 2020, it was done at My Community Pharmacy, a small independent community pharmacy that would put the needs of the patients first, often having medications delivered and patients the option of getting their medications handed to them outside the pharmacy, since these were trying times during the COVID pandemic. For his IPPE Health Systems rotation in 2021, it was done at Wellington Regional Medical center. There Mr. Omole saw the daily activities of pharmacy in the hospital setting, experienced rounds and patient care activities such as collecting a medication history, and the importance of data and informatics in the clinical setting. Currently, Mr. Omole is a pharmacy intern at CVS Health, where the patient/customer is of the utmost priority. </p>
                            <p>Since middle school, Mr. Omole always had a curious and inquisitive mind, which led him to the path of science, and eventually the healthcare industry. He participated in SECME in the 8th grade and earned the “Palm Beach County Outstanding Student of The Year” award. He joined the American Pharmacist Association – Academy of Student Pharmacists (APhA-ASP) chapter to develop a good network in the future to prepare for his career. He serves as the Vice President of the Christian Pharmacists Fellowship International at the Palm Beach Campus of NSU, coordinating events with the main campus at Ft. Lauderdale. He loves to play basketball, football, soccer, table tennis, and video games, and enjoys completing puzzles.</p>
